-- Get the tests in `spec/select_spec.rb` to pass. Note that for this section, the database will be seeded 
-- with external data from the `lib/seed.sql` file so don't expect it to reflect the data you added above. 
-- Note: Since it's a Ruby file, write your queries as strings in the `lib/sql_queries.rb`.

-- You may be expected to use SQL statements that 
-- you're not particularly familiar with. Make sure you use the resources and Google to find the right statements.
